    <h1>1975-1989</h1>
    <p>During this time period, our restaurant underwent a significant expansion, as we moved to a larger location in order to 
    accommodate our growing customer base. We also added several new dishes to our menu, including our now-famous Lobster Pie Pizza and 
    Crab and Street Corn Nachos. Our commitment to using fresh, high-quality ingredients remained unchanged, and we continued to take pride in 
    providing exceptional service to our customers. With our expanded space and menu, we became a favourite dining destination for 
    locals and tourists alike, and our reputation for authentic Mexican cuisine began to spread.</p>

    <h1>1990-2000</h1>
    <p>In the 1990s, our restaurant underwent another period of growth and innovation. We introduced several new menu items that 
    were inspired by the cuisine of various regions in Mexico, and we also began to incorporate more vegetarian and gluten-free options 
    into our offerings. Our commitment to quality and service never wavered, and we continued to be a go-to spot for those seeking 
    delicious Mexican cuisine. We also began to cater more frequently to private events, and our catering services quickly became a 
    popular choice for weddings, corporate events, and other special occasions.</p>
